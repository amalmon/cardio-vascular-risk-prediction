# cardio-vascular-risk-prediction
ML based supervisory classification project

## Problem Statement

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of 
Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient 
has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the 
patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Variables Each 
attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and 
medical risk factors

## Approaches

   1. Primary analysis & Data cleaning
   
   2. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
     
     single varietie and multivariate
   3. FEATURE ENGINEERING FOR MODELING
    
    label encoding, one-hot encoding, SMOTE, Scaling,
    
   4. MODELING
   
   
## Results

Here we mainly used 4 types of different classification algorithms: logistic 
regression, k-nearest neighbors’ classification, XG booster and Random Forest 
classification.2 hyper parameter tuning technique combinations also used along with 
these algorithms such as randomized search cv and grid search cv. After all, totally 
verified 7 classification model predictions. And evaluated each model output with 
more than five evaluation parameters.
 Out of all evaluations Random Forest with randomized search cv gave maximum 
good results for this classification prediction problem with better predictions.



Overweight diabetes BP are mainly due to today's bad food habits and 
unhealthy lifestyles. Good food and exercise are best prevention medicine

‘Prevention is better than cure’
## Challenges

Grid search cv took too much run time because of it tries all combinations of 
parameters grid for each model
Needed more computational time for model preparation
Finding an appropriate model was little difficult and also time consuming

## Future Scopes
